# Pdf-image-Exporter

Crude Java utility/script that uses [Pdfimages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pdfimages) to extract all images from a PDF document in ~~PNG~~ GIF format.

## Why Java?

Wanted to learn how to use external binaries in Java programs.

## How to use?

```
java -jar export-images.jar path/to/pdf/file
```

(for latest Windows compatible version see [here](https://github.com/pgram1/Pdf-image-Exporter/releases/latest))
